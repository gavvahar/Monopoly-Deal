# Monopoly Deal Game - GitHub Copilot Instructions

Always reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.

## Overview
Monopoly Deal is a FastAPI-based web card game with PostgreSQL database support, Docker containerization, and comprehensive testing. The application was recently converted from Flask to FastAPI and follows a function-based architecture (no classes allowed by CI).

## Working Effectively

### Bootstrap and Dependencies
Install Python dependencies (takes 30-60 seconds in normal environments):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Common Network Issues**: In sandboxed environments, pip install may fail with SSL certificate errors or timeouts. If this occurs:
- Dependencies are already installed in most environments
- Skip Docker builds which will also fail with network issues
- Focus on running the already-installed local application

### Development Server
Start the FastAPI development server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```

Start production server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

**NEVER CANCEL**: Server startup takes 2-5 seconds. Set timeout to 30+ seconds.

### Testing
Run FastAPI application tests (fast - takes ~0.5 seconds):
```bash
python test_fastapi.py
```

Run database module tests (requires PostgreSQL running):
```bash
python test_database.py
```

**Note**: Database tests will fail with "connection refused" if PostgreSQL is not running. This is expected in environments without database access.

### Code Quality (Required by CI)
Always run before committing changes:

Check code formatting (takes ~0.2 seconds):
```bash
black --check .
```

Apply code formatting:
```bash
black .
```

Run linting (takes ~0.2 seconds):
```bash
flake8 --max-line-length=88 .
```

**CRITICAL**: The CI enforces no Python classes - use only functions. The build will fail if any class definitions are found.

### Docker (May fail in sandboxed environments)
Copy environment configuration:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Clean up existing containers:
```bash
docker compose down --remove-orphans --volumes
```

Start full stack:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

**Common Issue**: Docker builds may fail with SSL/network errors in sandboxed environments. In this case, use the local development server instead.

## Validation

### Manual Testing Scenarios
Always manually validate changes by running through these scenarios:

1. **Basic Application Access**:
   - Start server: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001`
   - Test home page: `curl http://localhost:8001/` (should return 200)
   - Test login page: `curl http://localhost:8001/login` (should contain "username" and "password")
   - Test API docs: `curl http://localhost:8001/docs` (should contain "swagger")

2. **Core Functionality Test**:
   - Access http://localhost:8001/ in browser
   - Verify login form appears with Monopoly Deal branding
   - Test invalid login: `curl -s -d "username=invalid&password=wrong" -X POST http://localhost:8001/login | grep "Invalid username or password"`
   - Check theme toggle functionality works (‚òÄÔ∏è Light ‚Üî üåô Dark)

3. **API Documentation**:
   - Verify http://localhost:8001/docs loads Swagger UI
   - Verify http://localhost:8001/redoc loads alternative docs

### Automated Validation
Always run the test suite:
```bash
python test_fastapi.py
```

Expected output should include:
- "‚úì Home page test passed"
- "‚úì Login page GET test passed" 
- "‚úì API docs test passed"
- "‚úÖ All tests passed!"

## Common Tasks

### Service Access Points (Docker)
- Web Application: http://localhost:8001
- pgAdmin: http://localhost:5050
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5434 (external connections)
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8001/docs

### Port Conflicts
If you get "port already in use" errors:
1. Stop existing containers: `docker compose down`
2. Check conflicting services: `lsof -i :8001` or `netstat -tuln | grep 8001`
3. Change WEB_PORT in `.env` file (e.g., WEB_PORT=8002)

### Key File Locations
- **Main application**: `main.py` (FastAPI app)
- **Database operations**: `database.py` (function-based, no classes)
- **Game logic**: `game.py`, `cards.py`, `rules.py`
- **Templates**: `templates/` (Jinja2 HTML templates)
- **Static assets**: `static/` (CSS, JS, images)
- **Tests**: `test_fastapi.py`, `test_database.py`
- **Configuration**: `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, `requirements.txt`

### Environment Configuration
Default database settings (Docker containers):
- PostgreSQL: `172.20.0.12:5432`
- Database Service: `172.20.0.10`
- Web App: `172.20.0.11`
- PgAdmin: `172.20.0.13`

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **CRITICAL**: No Python classes allowed - CI will fail if classes are detected
- Use function-based architecture for all code
- Follow Black formatting (88 character line limit)
- Pass Flake8 linting with max-line-length=88

### Making Changes
1. Always run tests before and after changes: `python test_fastapi.py`
2. Format code: `black .`
3. Check linting: `flake8 --max-line-length=88 .`
4. Test manually by starting the server and accessing endpoints
5. **Never skip validation steps** - CI will fail if code quality checks don't pass

### Database Considerations
- Database operations are function-based in `database.py`
- Default configuration uses Docker container IPs
- Database initialization has 5-second timeout to prevent hanging
- Tests include mocked database operations for environments without PostgreSQL

## Troubleshooting

### Network/SSL Issues
- pip install failures: Dependencies likely already installed, continue with local development
- Docker build failures: Use local development server instead
- Certificate errors: Expected in sandboxed environments, not a code issue

### Application Issues
- "Database initialization timed out": Expected without PostgreSQL, app continues to work
- Port conflicts: Change ports in `.env` or stop conflicting services
- Import errors: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### CI/CD Failures
- Black formatting: Run `black .` to fix
- Flake8 linting: Fix syntax/style issues reported
- Class detection: Remove any `class` definitions and use functions instead
- Prettier formatting: Install Node.js and run `prettier --write "**/*.{html,css,js}"`

## Performance Notes
- **NEVER CANCEL**: All commands complete quickly (under 1 minute)
- Dependencies install: 30-60 seconds (may timeout in sandboxed environments)
- Server startup: 2-5 seconds
- Tests: ~0.5 seconds  
- Linting: ~0.2 seconds each
- Manual validation: 1-2 minutes for complete testing

Set timeouts of 30+ seconds for server operations, 60+ seconds for dependency installation.
