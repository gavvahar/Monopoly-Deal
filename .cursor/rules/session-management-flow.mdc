# session-management-flow

The session management system implements key business rules around game session lifecycles:

## Core Session Rules

- Maximum 5 players per game session
- Session creation restricted during business hours (9AM-5PM EST, Mon-Fri)
- Joining existing sessions allowed during business hours
- Admin bypass available for restricted hours via 2FA

## Session Lifecycle States

1. Creation
- New sessions can only be created outside business hours
- Creator automatically joins as first player
- Session remains in "waiting" state until started

2. Joining
- Players can join any session in "waiting" state
- Enforced 5-player maximum limit
- Player joins blocked if session is full
- No restrictions on join timing (allowed during business hours)

3. Management
- Sessions track current player count
- State transitions: waiting -> active -> completed
- Players can leave active sessions
- Session auto-closes if all players leave

## Admin Session Control

- Admins can bypass business hours restrictions
- Requires valid admin password + TOTP code
- Bypass remains active for admin's session duration
- Admin privileges tracked at session level
